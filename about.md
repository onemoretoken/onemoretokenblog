## Welcome to Tokenfiend

This blog chronicles my explorations into the world of Large Language Models, from practical prompting techniques to experiments with emerging AI capabilities.

### What drives this blog?

Like many who work with LLMs, I've found that:
- Every model has quirks worth documenting
- Small prompt changes can yield dramatically different results
- The field moves so fast that even last month's best practices need revisiting
- There's value in sharing both successes and failures

### Topics you'll find here

- **Prompting strategies** that actually work in production
- **Model comparisons** across different tasks and use cases
- **Integration patterns** for building with LLM APIs
- **Token economics** and optimization techniques
- **Emergent behaviors** and unexpected capabilities

### Why "Tokenfiend"?

Because if you're deep enough into this space to be reading random blogs about LLMs, you're probably as obsessed with tokens, context windows, and attention mechanisms as I am.
