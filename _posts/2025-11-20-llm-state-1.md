title: "This blog will contain my LLM-discoveries and hold my continously updated secret LLM-leaderboard"
---

This blog will be the place where I share all interesting things I find and learn about LLMs.
I will also be using this blog as a place where I comment on and continously update my own personal LLMs leaderboard as I am not satisfied with the selection of leaderboards to be found on huggingface nor and artificialanalysis nor on youtube.
I will not be sharing how I test this as that might quickly be trained on.
